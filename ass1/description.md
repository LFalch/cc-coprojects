# Assignment 1

Make a `file(1)` utility that takes in file paths for file to analyse as arguments. For each file, it will print out to the user what kind of contents it has. If no path is given, it will instead print out a usage message. For each file, if any kind of error occurs, it writes an explanation of the error (usually file not found, is a directory or missing read permissions).

## Example

Shows the expected output of running your file program on a couple of files. Example files are contained in this folder. Do `chmod -r noread` first for the correct error.

```sh
myfile a empty description.md iso8859-1.txt utf8.txt data.data noread
a: error file not found
empty: empty
description.md: ASCII text
iso8859-1.txt: ISO-8859 text
utf8.txt: UTF-8 Unicode text
data.data: data
noread: error no read permission
```

## File formats

- empty: the file is empty
- ASCII text: the file contains ASCII text that is files only with bytes `0x07...0x0d`, `0x1b` and `0x20...0x7e`.
- ISO 8859-1 text: the file contains the ASCII-extension aka. Latin1 that is ASCII or bytes with decimal value 160-255.
- UTF-8 text: valid UTF-8 text (see UTF-8 on Wikipedia)
- data: any data file that isn't recognised

We will discuss further files to add.
